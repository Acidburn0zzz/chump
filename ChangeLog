	* Catch-up.  Too much magic has happened since the last entry.
	The main news is that with Quixote the Chump can now serve its
	own web pages if you want it to, and that it can ping a URL of
	your choice when the XML is updated--thereby allowing real-time
	indexing or things like that.

	* Updated INSTALL and manual page.

2004-12-13  Edd Dumbill <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* EntityEncoderU.py, EntityEncoder.py: remove dependency on
	xmllib, add 'coding:' magicomment.

	* churnparser.py: delete as obsoleted by churnsaxparser.py

	* dailychumptwist.py: Fix for Twisted 1.3's API.
	Reordered things so DailyChurn object is created independently of
	the protocol factories.
	
	* dailychump.py: Added a listener mechanism API so that the
	protocols can register as listeners for Churn events when they
	happen.  Define listener interface as IChumpListener.


2002-08-01  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* Added 'status' command which shows addressing and verbosity
	levels.

	* Added --address (-r).  Bot only responds in public if it's
	been addressed by name.

	* Added --private (-i) mode so informational and error messages are
	sent privately

	* Added --quiet (-q) mode so only error messages are reported

	* Added support for chumping ftp, irc, and news: URLs

	* Added --help and --version commands, GNU style as well as proper
	short and long getopts style handling.

	* Tidied up punctuation in what the bot says.

	* All commands work via private message as well as in public.

	* Added L:= directive for replacing a mistyped URL (L is label
	letter).

	* Merged Josh Lucas' patch for specifying passwords to an IRC
	server.

	* src/dailychumpbot.py: added option to specify stylesheet
	(-e). Made -h display usage information.

	* src/dailychump.py: added support for stylesheets. Fixed bug
	where os.rename() attempted to rename across volumes. Had to

	stylesheet directive. Future TODO: move the XML handling to be
	SAX-based.
