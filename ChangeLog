	sent privately

	* Added support for chumping ftp, irc, and news: URLs

	* Added --help and --version commands, GNU style as well as proper
	short and long getopts style handling.

	* Tidied up punctuation in what the bot says.

	* All commands work via private message as well as in public.

	* src/dailychumpbot.py: added option to specify stylesheet
	(-e). Made -h display usage information.

	where os.rename() attempted to rename across volumes. Had to

	SAX-based.
